# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Diego Fernando Pinzón López

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
Comprising a meticulously cleaned collection of 174,952 records, this dataset is structured across 16 distinct fields.
The data contains a relevant information about temporal data, bike stations and user data.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration during my analysis of the dataset, I extracted valuable insights related to bicycle trips in San Francisco. I discovered that
weekdays, particularly from Monday to Friday, exhibit higher activity compared to weekends, with Thursday standing out as the day of
highest engagement. In terms of trip duration, it was revealed that 62% of trips last less than 10 minutes, and 28.74% have a duration between
10 and 20 minutes, indicating that in general, 90% of trips are completed in under 20 minutes. Additionally, I identified hourly patterns with
significant trip participation between 8 to 9 in the morning and 5 to 6 in the afternoon.

Another notable aspect is the user composition, where 90% are customers, with 74.6% being male. Furthermore, active participation among
the young population, aged 27 to 39, was evident, with an average age of 34 for users. Despite gender differences, a distinct disparity in trip
duration is not evident. Regarding user types, it's observed that subscribers tend to have trips with an average duration 11 minutes shorter
than customers. These patterns remain consistent across different age groups. In summary, my analysis unveils how weekdays and specific
time slots are more conducive for bicycle trips, and how gender and user type differences influence trip duration in this city.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just three key findings that underscore fundamental aspects of the bicycle usage analysis in San Francisco:

Firstly, one of the key findings highlights the pattern of bicycle usage during weekdays and specific morning and afternoon hours.
This behavior can be attributed to the fact that residents of San Francisco primarily use bicycles for their daily commutes to work or when
returning home. I will explore how this trend could potentially shape urban mobility infrastructure and policies.

In a broader context, it becomes evident that men tend to require less time for bicycle usage and constitute a significant portion of the
bicycle user market. I will delve into how this gender disparity in bicycle usage presents opportunities for promoting gender equality in
mobility and advocating for sustainable transportation.

The third notable result emphasizes the contrasting bicycle usage time between users categorized as 'customers' and 'subscribers'. I will
examine how this disparity in usage time might reflect distinct user behavior and preferences. Furthermore, I will analyze how such
discrepancies could impact user retention strategies and the promotion of subscription-based models.
